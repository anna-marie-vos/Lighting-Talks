# Task runner - gulp
* Gulp is a build system. It helps to automate your front end workflow.
* This is a npm module that helps automate painful workflow related tasks.
* Gulp versus Grunt?... gulp is easier to learn and easier to maintain. 
* But it doesn't have as many plugins 
* Gulp uses the philosophy of "code over configuration"
* asynchronous and uses streams, so you can pipe different tasks into it.
