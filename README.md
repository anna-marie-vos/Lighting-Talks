# Node-Strict-mode
* "use-strict"

# Task runner - gulp
* Gulp is a build system. It helps to automate your front end workflow.
* This is a npm module that helps automate painful workflow related tasks.
* Gulp versus Grunt?... gulp is easier to learn and easier to maintain.
* But it doesn't have as many plugins
* Gulp uses the philosophy of "code over configuration"
* asynchronous and uses streams, so you can pipe different tasks into it.

# What is functional programming
* in programming there are a number of programming styles. these are:
* Imperative programming:
* (Think, chaos but with method to the madness)
*This was the first style of coding used for html functionallity such as button clicks and so on.
*So variables were defined globally,
*Functions did many activities and it was meant to do activities from top to bottom.
*And so JS got a bad reputation because of it got progressively harder to change/update or test.
* In summary Imperative programming = there were method to the madness, but it was madness none the less.
**
## Object-orientated programming:
* (think, cookie-cutter)
*Objects interact with each other and you can make various instances (or copies) of an object. It is popular in languages like C++,C# and so on. Typical language is Classes, objects and instances.
*Example: you have a class called human. And then objects names Jo, bob and Sam. Jo, bob and sam are all instances of the human class.
**
* Differences between Object-orientated programming and Functional programming:
*OOP is like a cookie-cutter. It is good when you have a fixed set of operations and you add new features that do not influence or change the original set of operations.
*functional programming are better because you can expand and add new operations to existing operations.
**
## Functional programming:
* (think, little black box and fightclub)
*What is functional programming? * It is a coding style that allows you to evolve the activities rather than the data. Example: functional programming sees functions as little black boxes. You give the function certain inputs and it spits out something else. The outputs are always consistant. Each function can be tested and the outputs can be guarenteed. Reducers and array methods like map and filter are good examples of this.
**
### Things to remember when writing true functional programming:
*Functions should always be pure. It should not keep remnants of data in your functions, that means variables should be local scope only. (think fightclub) Everything IN the function should STAY in the function.
